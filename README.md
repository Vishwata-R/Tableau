# Tableau

The Employee Performance Analysis Dashboard was created to evaluate workforce efficiency across various factors such as department, age, education level, training, salary, work-from-home frequency, team size, and promotions.
This dashboard helps HR and management make data-driven decisions to enhance employee productivity, optimize team structures, and improve training and development programs.
